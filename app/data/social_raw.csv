1k4keih,"[DD] Even If Elon Ditches DOGE for Tesla – It’s Too Little, Too Late","
There’s chatter that Elon might finally “refocus” on Tesla and distance himself from his side quests—most notably his weird obsession with Dogecoin. Bulls might think this is bullish: “He’s coming back! He’s serious again!”

But here’s the problem: he never left. He just stopped delivering.

🚫 Overpromising Is the Default Under Elon

Even if Elon announces he’s giving up on crypto clownery to zero in on Tesla, the core issue remains—his leadership style has fundamentally eroded trust.

Let’s look at the record:
	•	FSD “next year” since 2016 – still in beta, still not delivering revenue.
	•	Robotaxis by 2020 – we’re halfway through 2025.
	•	$25K Model? Vaporware.
	•	Cybertruck timeline? Delays, recalls, meme features (like bulletproof claims).

So, sure, maybe he tweets “I’m all-in on Tesla again,” but the Street has been burned too many times to believe it without tangible execution.

Sentiment Doesn’t Flip With a Tweet

The bigger issue? People just don’t like him anymore. And that matters.
	•	He’s aligned himself with culture war politics that have turned off core EV buyers.
	•	His Twitter/X activity has been erratic, controversial, and alienating.
	•	ESG investors and climate-focused funds are increasingly bailing on TSLA—not because of performance, but because they can’t sell “Elon” to clients anymore.

Saying “I’m focused now” doesn’t undo years of brand damage.


⚠️ Tariffs Are Still Crushing the Global Thesis

Even if Elon dials back the meme coins, the fundamentals don’t magically improve:
	•	US-EV tariffs are active (and Chinese LFP battery costs just went up).
	•	China just nuked S/X listings.
	•	EU could retaliate with their own tariffs.
	•	And Tesla is retreating from markets like Japan, UK, and Australia by discontinuing models.

This is structural. No PR pivot will fix supply chain pressure and margin hits.

🤔 Could Elon Turn It Around?

In theory, yes. If he:
	•	Delivered a real $25K model in 12–18 months.
	•	Partnered with OEMs for FSD licensing.
	•	Cleaned up comms, stepped back from X, and re-focused the brand.
	•	Resigned as CEO and brought in an operations-focused leader.

But let’s be real—Elon stepping aside from Dogecoin is not the same as stepping aside from being Elon. And his entire brand is built around showmanship, not execution.


Bottom Line

Even if Elon says he’s back, we’ve heard that song before—and the market’s tolerance for vapor promises is exhausted. Tesla is:
	•	A retreating brand.
	•	Losing trust.
	•	Still battling macro and regulatory headwinds.

Talk is cheap. Tariffs aren’t.

1k4gt06,TSLA Is on the Edge – Here’s Where the Floor Drops Out,"TSLA is teetering at critical support around $217–$220. If it breaks, it’s not just a dip—it’s the trapdoor to parabolic downside.
	•	$217.80 & $215.62 are long-standing technical floors. If those give way, we’re looking at a death cross, oversold RSI, and zero sentiment support = panic sell mode.
	•	No earnings guidance. No new products. Global pullbacks. Tariff headwinds.
	•	Public sentiment? Cratered. Elon’s political baggage and over-promises are catching up.
	•	Options market is pricing ±9%, and skew is bearish.

This is the setup for a classic bull trap. Once $217 snaps, expect algo flushes and margin pukes.
Break that floor and it’s sledding season.

1k4f8g9,TSLA 240 put gains today,"Got some puts and TSLZ on Thursday at a good price. Full port.

Asked Chat GPT to make some predictions about IV crush and theta decay. Was pleasantly surprised with the data it coughed up.

Ballpark was 230 on Monday or 220 on Tuesday was a good exit point, unless I expect it go way below that on Wednesday.

But TSLA has memestock cooties and the one lesson I got from WSB is to ride the foam and get off before the wave comes down. The market makers are the bedrock and you regards are the water.

Lo and behold it dropped to 230 today and kept dropping. So I timed my exit.

Earnings call (as everyone knows) is tomorrow after market.

Wanting to limit the exposure on a put position anticipating a sell off if earnings miss, but then move out of the put to some long term calls.   

Debating on the 350 July 2025's at $5.05  or taking it to March 2026 400's 

The goal is for a medium to higher risk strategy given the unique trading climate we are in.

Anyone have a good buy/sell game plan?

1k44v3v,🚨TESLA DD - THE MYTH OF “BOUNCING ON BAD EARNINGS” IS DEAD 🚨 (aka why this quarter is set up for a bloodbath),"TL;DR
Tesla’s “rise on bad earnings” is a dead meme. Those rare pops were driven by hype bombs that aren’t coming this time. Now, with public sentiment in the gutter, no guidance, tariff pain, Elon over-promising fatigue, and Model S/X getting pulled globally… this earnings is a setup for a brutal downside move.

⸻

🧟 “BUT TSLA RISES ON BAD NEWS!” – NOT ANYMORE

Let’s shut this down:
	•	Q4 2024 is the only real exception: Tesla missed both revenue and EPS but rose ~4% only because Elon teased a June robotaxi launch and new low-cost model plans.
	•	That bounce came after hours, only after the call—purely driven by forward guidance.
	•	Without those surprise announcements? TSLA always drops on a miss.

There is no consistent historical pattern of Tesla going up on bad earnings without major forward-looking hype. That’s not a trend. That’s luck + hopium.

⸻

⚠️ THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT – IN THE WORST WAY

1. No Guidance, No Hype, No Lifeline
	•	No Model 2.
	•	No robotaxi demo.
	•	No solid FSD timeline.
	•	Last call? Elon basically said “we’re not giving forward guidance anymore.”

2. Elon Over-Promising = Worn Out
	•	Promised Full Self-Driving “next year” since 2016. Still in beta.
	•	Robotaxis by 2020. Nope.
	•	“$25K Tesla soon.” Still nothing.
	•	Investors have heard it all, and they’re not buying it anymore without real action.

3. Public Sentiment Is TRASH
	•	Musk’s alliance with Trump has alienated core Tesla buyers and ESG-focused investors.
	•	He’s become a culture war figure, not an innovation icon.
	•	His Dogecoin pumping and Twitter chaos have made Tesla feel more like a meme than a market leader.
	•	Google Trends, Twitter mentions, and retail chatter have all cooled significantly—there’s no positive sentiment tailwind this time.

⸻

🧨 GLOBAL MODEL PULLBACKS = BAD SIGNALS

Tesla is literally discontinuing products in multiple markets:
	•	Model S & X canceled in Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Japan due to ending right-hand-drive production.
	•	China pulled U.S.-made Model S/X from its website—no more “Order Now” buttons. Tariffs are biting.
	•	U.S. killed off Model 3 RWD, its cheapest EV, because Chinese-made LFP battery tariffs made it unprofitable.

This is not growth. This is retreat.

⸻

🔥 TARIFF WAR = MARGIN SLAUGHTER
	•	10% U.S. tariffs on EVs are in effect, and reciprocals from the EU and China are brewing.
	•	Tesla’s global footprint means they’re hit from all sides.
	•	Elon himself admitted tariffs are “significant.” Translation: margins getting choked.

⸻

📉 OPTIONS + VOLATILITY
	•	Market is pricing a ±9% move.
	•	Skew is to the downside: when there’s no guidance and sentiment is weak, implied vol favors bearish plays.

Just Elon baggage, global retrenchment, and macro headwinds.

1jyfkuo,TSLA Q2 Deliveries,"Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter.

  
Why couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? 

Q1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally:

2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k:

US 128k

China 79k

EU 63k

RoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from:

Canada 8k

SK/JPN 9k

AU/NZ 6k

Mid East/LATAM combine for 21k

The current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries:

US 140k

China 86k

EU 69k

RoW 73k

Q1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. 

I'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated...

Above all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. 

On Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? 

At the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. 

Canada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? 

I could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised. I am bearish on TSLA fundamentals and think event contracts on Q2 deliveries might even be a decent way to hedge shenanigan risk on a stock short.

1jve93c,Repost: It's all about China,"**Mods removed this post yesterday when it had 700 upvotes, probably because it became too political. Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

1jv0l7a,It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously—it would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder—Vanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

1jthv06,watching for snapback setups off gap down open with historical reference and setup potential,"if open is lower than what we are all expecting, would focus on watching for short term reversal setups in a few oversold names. not necessarily entering into anything early but waiting for key levels to come into and watch for signs of exhaustion based on historical context in previous flushes discussed under, extreme pressure tends to revert when it gets stretched too far intraday.

so as for the historical context framework, after the 1987 crash the dow recovered about 57 percent in the two sessions that followed the bottom. same thing happened after the 2008 october flush and again in march 2020. 

the context shifts but the structure tends to repeat. liquidity dries up, forced selling takes over, and once that flow slows down you often get sharp intraday reversals even in weak broader trends. 
in 87 the crash accelerated because of dynamic hedging strategies that sold more as prices dropped, creating a feedback loop that hit futures first and then cash markets. books got overwhelmed, bids vanished, and once that flow exhausted the bounce came fast. 

in 08 it was margin pressure and credit risk. banks had to unwind whatever was liquid and those with tighter funding positions, pretty much made the selling spiral worse until coordinated policy stepped in. 
same thing again in 2020 where no one knew what earnings or demand would look like so everything risk got dumped. volatility went to the moon and alot sectors started moving in sync, and depth disappeared until liquidity support came in and flipped the tape. 

now the potential ‘black monday’ we face shouldn’t be a repeat of 87 imo, but some of the same stress points are showing up. risk is extended, volatility is climbing, liquidity’s thinning out, and this recent price action looks like the front end of a liquidation cycle. if we gap down hard and that volume keeps pushing into weak books, the key is watching when that forced flow dries up. that’s usually when things snap back fast intraday and structure starts to reset. nothing guaranteed but it’s a pattern that’s repeated across every major dislocation. 

recent positions similar to this framework include tsla calls on pre march 20th setups in hood, reddit and more. all of them opened heavy and reversed clean once selling pressure faded. setups were mostly based on volume spikes near prior levels and reclaiming vwap after early weakness. this kind of move matches intraday reversal probability especially when it comes from liquidity holes followed by clear buying into strength

still holding a bearish lean overall into 26’ and early 27’. positioned with spy 2026 puts and exposure in cvna and arkk. already explained the reasoning in previous posts in the sub. 

not expecting anything specific off the open just being ready. if the same conditions line up i will post what i see after the open. just keeping it systematic and letting the market set the pace what’s everyone thinking??",2025-04-07,23,43.0,0.74,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jthv06/watching_for_snapback_setups_off_gap_down_open/,Boodiiii,Post

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

1jzhipc,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

1jxvwyf,"Tesla's Stock Is Set For A ""Death Cross"" On Monday","Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.

Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?

Its technicals look rough

If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.

As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.

""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said.

Below is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close.

1jw5e1w,Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.,"Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. 

Position: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.

In two of my previous posts on r/stocks ""**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**"" and **""Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**"" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:

1. The ERDF.
2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.
3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.

Here is how it went down and what we can all learn:

Yesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:

Source: [Tesla’s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)

I think: ""*This is it. It's finally happening!*"". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. 

**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.

**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his ""outperform"" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into ""not-a-car-company"" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). 

\*Shit- not looking good now\*

**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). 

**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*

What did we learn? Two important things:

1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. 
2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. 

For those that want to know: The ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. 

**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). 

First, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.

\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...

I find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. 

Both Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* 

The thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: 

""*I say I’m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it’s mainly because it’s a meme stock now. It doesn’t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*

*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what’s happening.*""

As wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: ""Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock."" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: ""*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*"" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope.

1jz0rgj,"Trade Wars and Treasuries, or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds
(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

1k4db1v,Your Week Ahead in Stocks: Tech Earnings On Deck,"Here are five key things to know this week:

**Last Week's Whiplash: Health Scare, Chip Chill, Tariff Talk**

Major news last week included UnitedHealth's (UNH) massive plunge on weak guidance dragging the Dow, while Eli Lilly (LLY) surged on positive drug trial news. New US export licensing rules for AI chips hit semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), and ongoing tariff uncertainty, coupled with Presidential comments regarding the Fed Chair, kept volatility elevated. Netflix (NFLX) provided a bright spot with strong earnings.

**Mega-Cap Tech Earnings Floodgates Open**

This week marks the heart of Q1 earnings season, with a heavy focus on Big Tech. Key reports include Tesla (TSLA) Tuesday; Meta (META), IBM (IBM), and Boeing (BA) Wednesday; followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) on Thursday. Investors will scrutinize results and guidance, especially around AI spending, cloud growth, and impacts from the broader economic climate.

**Inflation and Growth Data Dump**

Two crucial economic reports are due: the first estimate of Q1 US GDP on Thursday, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Core PCE Price Index for March, on Friday. These releases will provide critical insights into the economy's trajectory and price pressures, heavily influencing expectations for future Federal Reserve policy. Look for potential market reactions surrounding these releases.

**Sentiment Remains Subdued Amid Uncertainty**

Despite some market resilience, overall investor sentiment remains weak, weighed down by persistent US-China trade friction, the potential economic drag from tariffs, and Fed policy uncertainty. Futures indicate a lower open this morning as markets grapple with these concerns ahead of the week's major catalysts. Watch for shifts in sentiment following earnings and economic data points.

**Busy Week Demands Investor Attention**

With numerous S&P 500 companies reporting alongside critical economic data, expect potentially significant market moves and sector rotations. Beyond tech, earnings from companies like Verizon (VZ), GE Aerospace (GE), Caterpillar (CAT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and AbbVie (ABBV) will also offer broad economic insights. Stay informed as headlines and data could shift the narrative quickly.

Markets opened green but lost momentum by midday, closing mostly flat. SPY gave up early gains as investors stayed cautious ahead of key inflation data and Fed comments later this week.

1jweej4,"[Insider Trading] Data Analysis for April 10, 2025 (Last 12 Hours) in the Context of Global Markets and Sector Performance","# Market Context

Global markets experienced a significant sell-off on April 10, 2025:

* **S&P 500 Futures (ES=F)**: Closed at 5,298.00, down 3.78% from 5,506.25 on April 9.
* **Dow Jones Futures (YM=F)**: Dropped to 39,760.00 from 40,891.00, a 2.77% decline.
* **VIX (\^VIX)**: Surged to 43.99 from 32.92, a 33.63% increase, indicating heightened volatility.
* **Shanghai Composite (000001.SS)**: Bucked the trend, rising 1.16% to 3,223.64.

Sector performance reflected this bearish sentiment:

* **Technology**: Declines of 4-7% (e.g., NVDA -5.91%, META -6.74%, AAPL -4.24%).
* **Energy**: Sharp drops (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%).
* **Consumer Cyclical**: Notable losses (e.g., TSLA -7.27%).
* **Healthcare**: Mixed results (e.g., UNH +2.75%, LLY -4.35%).
* **Financial Services**: Broad declines (e.g., JPM -3.09%, BAC -3.50%).

This volatile market environment, possibly driven by macroeconomic factors like tariffs or economic data, sets the stage for interpreting insider trading activity over the updated 12-hour window.

# Insider Trading Activity (Last 12 Hours: 06:30 PDT to 18:30 PDT)

Below is a detailed breakdown of key insider transactions within the last 12 hours, organized by sector, with implications tied to market and sector performance. The updated time frame (shifted from 1:00 PM EST, or 10:00 AM PDT, to 18:30 PDT) potentially includes additional transactions up to 18:30 PDT.

# Technology Sector

* **Market Performance**: The sector saw significant declines, with major stocks like NVDA (-5.91%), META (-6.74%), and AAPL (-4.24%) reflecting broad selling pressure.
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **Phreesia (PHR)**: Multiple executives sold shares:
      * CEO Chaim Indig: Sold $290,218.
      * SVP David Linetsky: Sold $99,990.
      * COO Evan Roberts: Sold $172,527.
      * General Counsel Allison Hoffman: Sold $252,777.
      * CFO Balaji Gandhi: Sold $191,895.
      * **Total**: Approximately $1.16 million.
      * **Note**: While web results mention a CFO sale on March 29, 2025 (outside our window), these transactions are assumed to fall within the last 12 hours based on the provided data.
      * **Implication**: Coordinated sales by top executives suggest caution, possibly due to sector headwinds or company-specific concerns.
   * **Cloudflare (NET)**: CEO Matthew Prince sold $249,015 and an additional $16 million in stock:
      * **Total**: Approximately $16.25 million.
      * **Implication**: This substantial sale could indicate profit-taking or unease about further sector declines, though it may also reflect a pre-planned trading schedule.
   * **Asana (ASAN)**: CEO Dustin Moskovitz bought shares in two transactions:
      * $6.7 million and $6.72 million.
      * **Total**: Approximately $13.42 million.
      * **Implication**: This significant purchase signals strong confidence in Asana’s future, viewing the sector’s sell-off as a buying opportunity.

# Energy Sector

* **Market Performance**: Energy stocks declined sharply (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%).
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **CVR Energy (CVI)**: Activist investor Carl Icahn acquired 665,449 shares from April 8 to April 10, 2025, totaling approximately $11.1 million:
      * **Specific to April 10**: The portion of this purchase on April 10 falls within the 12-hour window (exact breakdown unspecified but confirmed active on this date per web results).
      * **Context**: CVR Energy’s stock has dropped over 50% in the past year, positioning it as a potential value play.
      * **Implication**: Icahn’s contrarian buy suggests he sees upside potential, possibly anticipating a sector recovery or company-specific catalysts.

# Consumer Cyclical Sector

* **Market Performance**: The sector weakened, with stocks like TSLA declining 7.27%.
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **Rush Street Interactive (RSI)**: Multiple insiders sold shares:
      * CEO Richard Schwartz: Sold $2.06 million.
      * CIO Einar Roosileht: Sold $111,600.
      * COO Mattias Stetz: Sold $14,676.
      * **Total**: Approximately $2.19 million.
      * **Implication**: These sales align with sector struggles, potentially reflecting concerns about consumer spending or industry-specific risks.

# Other Notable Transactions

* **Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO) - Communication Services**: Insider Arturo Moreno bought $1.73 million:
   * **Implication**: Optimism about advertising recovery or company growth amid sector declines (e.g., META -6.74%).
* **Gamestop (GME) - Consumer Cyclical**: Director Alain Attal bought $257,500:
   * **Implication**: Suggests belief in a potential rebound or undervaluation.
* **RenovoRx (RNXT) - Healthcare**: VP Controller Ronald Kocak and CMO Agah Ramtin bought shares totaling \~$34,399:
   * **Implication**: Modest buys in a smaller-cap biotech indicate confidence amid mixed sector performance.

# Key Insights and Implications

1. **Technology Sector**: Mixed signals emerge, with significant sells at Phreesia and Cloudflare indicating caution, contrasted by Asana’s large buy suggesting selective optimism. The sector’s 4-7% declines may reflect valuation concerns or macroeconomic pressures, but Asana’s CEO sees value.
2. **Energy Sector**: Icahn’s $11.1 million purchase of CVR Energy stock (partially on April 10) is a standout contrarian move. With the sector down sharply and CVR Energy off 50% in the past year, this buy could signal a bet on recovery or activist strategy.
3. **Consumer Cyclical Sector**: Insider sales at Rush Street Interactive reinforce the sector’s weakness, hinting at worries about consumer demand or competitive pressures.
4. **Extended Time Window**: Shifting from 10:00 AM PDT (1:00 PM EST) to 18:30 PDT extends the analysis by 8.5 hours, potentially capturing more transactions. For instance, Icahn’s April 10 purchase is confirmed within this period, while earlier transactions (e.g., “16 minutes ago” from 13:00 PDT) remain relevant if within the 06:30-18:30 PDT range.
5. **Volatility Context**: The VIX at 43.99 highlights market uncertainty. Sells in struggling sectors may reflect risk aversion, while buys could indicate insiders exploiting perceived overreactions.

# Conclusion

As of 18:30 PDT on April 10, 2025, insider trading activity over the last 12 hours reveals a cautious stance in Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors, with significant sells at Phreesia, Cloudflare, and Rush Street Interactive aligning with their sectors’ poor performance. Conversely, notable buys in Technology (Asana) and Energy (CVR Energy) suggest some insiders see value amid the sell-off. With the VIX at 43.99 signaling high volatility, investors should weigh these insider signals carefully alongside broader market trends. The updated time frame to 18:30 PDT broadens the scope of transactions considered, reinforcing the mixed sentiment in this turbulent market environment.",2025-04-11,7,11.0,0.74,stockmarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jweej4/insider_trading_data_analysis_for_april_10_2025/,Mamuthone125,Post

Well, yesterday was crazy. Today I'm somewhat negatively biased because obviously this 90 day tariff pause doesn't change too much narratively in the market beyond less chaos (for now)- we still need to negotiate with every country that we plan to place tariffs on while China is still the elephant in the room and the US needs to face them down

Shorter format today, my sleep schedule has been terrible due to premarket/regular/afterhours/overnight trading.

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

Signs of internal conflict within the White House (he called Navarro dumber than a sack of bricks lol) signal some political risk. 

Overall, biased negatively today sheerly because there's been no real change in tariffs beyond the 90 day delay. Level I'm watching is 250 (far, I know), frankly don't know which way or how far the market will turn after the open today though.

This entire deal is a mess. Frankly at this point, I'm only going to buy the stock if there is a clear buyer like Nippon, which is the only way I see a viable trade in this now. Keeping track of the narrative and incremental headlines is frankly a difficult way to earn money vs the tariff trades that are possible.

Unit sales missed with 301,811 total vehicles sold vs 312,800 expected; both retail and wholesale fell below consensus. Used auto demand remains mixed, with macro headwinds impacting affordability and dealer traffic. Despite stronger earnings, volume misses suggest softness (this should be stronger due to people trying to buy cars due to tariffs). Slower unit sales hint at potential demand weakness or pricing compression

D**oing the short formatting today because all of you know what  the news is,** it's mainly about stock selection/risk tolerance today. I think we might have a minor bounce today, but likely going to bail out of all positions if we break the lows in the markets today.

Ordered the tickers from least riskiest to MOST. I think trading (shorting) expecting FURTHER selloffs is essentially betting on outlier moves at this point, so I am (barely) bullish. We may have more tariff announcements on China from Trump, but watch Trump's social media accounts for any marginally positive headlines based on if he has calls with leaders from other countries.

[**F (Ford)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d) / [**STLA (Stellantis)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=STLA&p=d) / [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d) / [**CAT (Caterpillar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CAT&p=d)\- Overall screwed mainly due to the massive tariff exposure they have, not too interested in investing in any of these hoping for a change on tariffs.

[**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)\- Also facing a major downturn mainly due to the selloff in BTC, Cathie Woods bought in but that's not too meaningful. Interested in the $137.50 level.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Mainly looking at this due to AAPL being the most exposed of the MAG7 due to iPhones, interested in what it does after if it breaks $180.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Dan Ives (a historically bullish analyst) has slashed his price target to $315 (from $550), calling it a ""political symbol"" and says that the ""brand crisis tornado has turned into a F5 tornado"". Overall still consider this uninvestible.

[**SVIX (Short VIX 1X ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SVIX&p=d) / **(short** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**)**\- The short VIX trade- SVIX isn't meant to be held for longer than one day (it's an inverse VIX futures ETF), VXX is a better choice if you choose to short vol (but still not meant to be held for more than a few weeks). This is not for beginners, please understand what ""backwardation"", ""inverse futures ETF"", and what happened in XIV in 2018 before you trade this.

Seeking Feedback on My $100K Market Crash Plan: Insights Welcome!

I’ve analyzed SPY, GLD, Bitcoin, and M7 returns over the last decade, including Average Annual Returns (AAR) and 12-month post-COVID dip performance.
According to my analysis, 12 months after a market crash, my returns could range between 24% and 83%.

Bitcoin rate of return is adjusted.
PS: I know timing the market isn’t realistic—just looking for advice on my approach!

Don’t you agree that it’s a duck?’ And the accountants say, ‘Yes, according to the rules, this is a duck.’ Everybody knows that it’s a dog, not a duck, but that doesn’t matter, because you’ve met the rules for calling it a duck.”

1jyfkuo,,"I see the recent resignation of the chief financial controller as a red flag.

The CFO is the head of finance of any company of course but that can be much more of a “man management” position (there’s a word that begins “pol” and ends “itical” to describe the CFO role but this subreddit won’t let me use it). The CFO has to keep the CEO happy and investors and banks etc - he won’t do much actual accounting.

The financial controller is focused on the actual debits and credit, implementing the accounting policies and getting the numbers right.  This means he’s also he’s on the front line for actual accounting malfeasance and if a CFO gives him some “read between the lines” instructions to manipulate the accounts he’s the guy that actually has to do it and a leading candidate to go to jail if it goes wrong.

At the time of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy the CFO was this ditzy hedge fund saleswoman who probably didn’t know a debit from a credit. Whistleblowers came from the financial control department saying dodgy stuff was going on.

I would be completely unsurprised if the same dynamic worked at Tesla and that’s why the financial controller bailed.",2025-04-13,49,,,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jyfkuo/tsla_q2_deliveries/,Suspicious-Town-7688,Top Comment (from relevant post)

1jvijnj,,"I don't trade QQQ, but for SPY....

It went up another 4.12% at the start of the next day, before dropping 8.67% intraday, and ending the day down 5.69% after an end of day rebound.

The next day it gapped down to start, and was down over 10% in a straight shot.

The next day it gapped up 1.76% before dropping 5.2%, before rebounding back up 9.5%, and finally finishing slightly below the intraday high for a total gain of 4.17%.

Yadda yadda yadda.

With HUGE intraday movements like this, even intraday price moves can make or break your account.  They're VERY risky.

What's important for everyone to understand is that a huge moves like we've been experience often result in range based waves of price movement, often over multiple days.   If you can mark out the general support and resistance areas and constrain yourself from getting too greedy with 0DTEs and trying to hit the trend lines on the dot, you can make a good deal of money by playing the general wake of the explosion we just witnessed in the market today.

So for example... what happened after that move in 2008...

Draw the line between the high 10/7/2008 to the high 10/14/2008 and extend it out to the right.  Mirror the line and drag the copy down to the bottom of the 10/10/2008 candle.  Now look at the range the ripples from that massive move created in its wake.

This isn't to say we know the future and can draw these lines yet... hell... we don't even know if this move is topped out yet or we'll see another day or two of buying... but we can get the gist of what might happen over the following weeks based on that past example.  Maybe the general trend over the coming weeks is up... maybe it's down... but look at how big the range of the up and down moves are over that period and how long it takes to get from the support side of the range to the resistance side of the range.  Now, it really doesn't matter where those lines end up today... if we presume we may see a similar wake ... then now you have a better idea of safer places to buy and sell, without knowing exactly where the range's support / resistance lines will ultimately be.

And of course, always protect your trades with stops.  Who knows what this shit stain POTUS is going to do next.",2025-04-09,1261,,,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jvijnj/biggest_oneday_gain_for_the_nasdaq_since_10132008/,EarthConservation,Top Comment (from relevant post)

1jve93c,,"First it was about illegal immigration.  
Then it was about fentanyl.  
Then it was human trafficking.  
Then it was about Europe needing to pay their fair share for defense spending.  
Then it was about rare earth minerals in Ukraine and Greenland.  
Then it was 1:1 reciprocal tariffs.  
Then it was leveling out the entire global trade deficit.  
And now it's about China?

Like many investors have learned the hard way over the last few weeks, it's a fool's errand to try and discern what the intentions are, what could happen tomorrow, what could happen at 3am from a post to TruthSocial, or what could happen next week.

Which is the same reason nobody's spinning up new factories here because of this. Manufacturing plants take 5 years to build for a 50-year investment and god only knows what's going to happen two days or months from now that's going to wipe out a billion dollar capital investment in manufacturing. Because the patients are running the insane asylum, their demands change on a whim, and whatever incentives there are to invest in the US can change a moment's notice.

Because there's ***no*** plan. Except maybe market manipulation and ego stroking.

EDIT:

For those who want to debate that it's always been about China, go for it, but you'll then have to explain why the best possible path forward was to alienate, quite literally, almost every country on the planet and every single one of our closest allies along the way.",2025-04-09,1224,,,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jve93c/repost_its_all_about_china/,Boomshtick414,Top Comment (from relevant post)

1k3hu2i,,"-Shipping container fees were released.

-Edit: Trucking rates from California plummeting in May. See comments below.

-Tesla announced delay of there economy model

-WSJ said phones are increasing 300$ in production costs (edit: this is a few weeks old and was reported by WSJ and not Apple. I apologize.)

 -- TSMC has reported that they are increasing chip prices across the board which will directly impact Apple who primarily sources there parts from them. The impacts are yet to be seen.

-- Caveat: Apple is a well run company and has been stock pilling devices. They also have a lot of pull to circumvent fees and price hikes. They also have seen a spike in demand as people have been buying early to avoid hikes. I was originally bearish on Apple but they have the secret sauce to stave off a lot of medium/short term draw down and demand impact. They also have the capital to find ways to import goods cheaply.

-Flip flop on head of IRS

-Trump pushing some schedule to make it easy to fire gov employees.

1jwb68p,,"The volatility we experienced in the past few days is very similar to the commonly-used example of volatility decay.

Let's imagine there is a stock trading at $100 and a -2x inverse ETF on this $100 stock that also costs $100.

If the stock has a 10% move up and then a 9.09% move down the stock ends at:  
$100 \* (1 + 10%) \* (1 - 9.09%) = $100

The leveraged ETF will have a -20% move down and then an 18.18% move up:

$100 \* (1 - 20%) \* (1 + 18.18%) = $94.54.

Even though the stock ended up even, the leveraged ETF ended up negative.

No one is saying there is a new safe haven now or let us all trust the China Government (CCCP). The point is this can be a starting point of geopolitical shift not in favor of US. These things take time, remember the ocean liner example by Obama in New Yorker in 2016:

> They are like ocean liners: you turn the wheel slowly, and the big ship pivots. Sometimes your job is just to make stuff work. Sometimes the task of government is to make incremental improvements or to try to steer the ocean liner two degrees north or south so that, ten years from now, suddenly we’re in a very different place than we were. At the moment, people may feel like we need a fifty-degree turn; we don’t need a two degree turn. And you say, Well, if I turn fifty degrees the whole ship turns over.

What the current President thinking is - US is the safe haven and global reserve so we have all the advantage in negotiation and where else are people going to go. So I can do whatever I want and I will come out on top. This will be true now and yes US will come out on top, but by doing so he has steered the ocean liner 2 or 3 degrees south (in not so favorable direction). For e.g. look at this table - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP it took China nearly 45 years to be here and that too with some oppressive democractic ideas.

Right now alliances are being rethought and everyone is redoing their long term plans with assumption US can be unreliable. Come on, we pissed off Canada, of all the countries Canada who has been like the most reliable brother you can have. You always have a friend who will show up no matter what and will do what you ask with ""no questions asked"", that has been Canada for US and you go and piss them off and mistreat them :(

That said, I think a strengthening CNY may be a price China is willing to pay, especially if it accompanies a broader unwinding of global trust in the U.S. If they can weather high tariffs (and the corresponding dip in trade), they may be less concerned about near-term currency competitiveness.

If you're curious about active trading, start small and keep it simple. I'd recommend checking out beginner-friendly stock screeners and learning a few basic but powerful indicators. I would go with some basic indicators, such as Supertrend, which would help you to catch momentum shifts and ride the waves between trends without needing to stare at charts all day. You can also pair it with some other technical indicators to filter out noise.

There are some communities and platforms out there focused on trend-based strategies for new traders. I’ve been using one that’s super beginner-friendly. DM me if you're curious, I can point you in the right direction without getting this post flagged 😅

musk cooks the books and plays fast and loose with the legality of his business actions.

1jtaydv,,"Your allocation looks solid, but there are a few things worth considering about crash preparedness that I learned from running a financial platform.

The M7 tech allocation (30%) combined with tech-heavy ETFs might create hidden concentration risk. During downturns, tech stocks often show high correlation. I'd consider reducing tech exposure and adding some counter-cyclical sectors like utilities or consumer staples.

Speaking of real data, we've been analyzing thousands of investor portfolios at THE XIRR, Inc., and noticed that those who weathered market crashes best typically had 15-20% in true alternative investments - stuff like P2P lending, litigation finance, or invoice discounting. These tend to have low correlation with public markets. While Coinbase and gold are good, they still correlate with general market sentiment during crashes.

Your HYSA allocation seems low given current rates. With some online banks offering 5%+, bumping this to 15-20% could provide both safety and decent returns. This cash position also lets you capitalize on opportunities during the downturn.

One last thing - I notice most of your picks are US-focused. Consider adding some exposure to markets like India or Southeast Asia. Their growth trajectories and monetary policies often diverge from US markets, providing real diversification when you need it most. Plus their demographic trends look promising for the next decade.",2025-04-07,1,,,stockmarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jtaydv/are_your_2025_market_crash_strategies_ready_to/,Narrow-Resident-3396,Top Comment (from relevant post)
